Module: XML::SAXDriver::Excel

Description:
    XML::SAXDriver::Excel provides a SAX interface to easily transform Excel documents into XML.  
    The module uses Spreadsheet::ParseExcel to parse Excel files and simultaneously write out XML data.  
    XML::SAXDriver::Excel allows to create your own Spreadsheet::ParseExcel object with defaults that 
    fit your needs or just use defaults.  There will be more handlers added later (ex. DTD, etc...).  
    This module complements the XML::Excel module and should be used to provide a lightweight SAX
    interface which enhances performance and well as decreases the memory foot mark.
